*Play--Scaffold*

To use, reference the module from your application.conf:
module.scaffold=C:/Path/To/Play/Modules/scaffold/

Then create your project:
play new

Actually, maybe you should create your project first, and then edit its application.conf.

Now, add some JPA or Siena models. The model entities have to extend play.db.jpa.Model or siena.Model.

Then run:
play scaffold:gen --overwrite

Then launch your application:
play run

Then marvel at how awesome the Play! framework is.

[optional] Now, get to work making your application useful or something.
