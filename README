Welcome to the Play—Scaffold wiki!

To use, reference the module from your application.conf:
module.scaffold=C:/Path/To/Play/Modules/scaffold/

Then create your project:
play new

Then add some JPA or Siena models. The model entities have to extend play.db.jpa.Model or siena.Model.

Then run:
play scaffold:gen —overwrite

Then launch your application:
play run

Then marvel at how awesome the Play! framework is.

[optional] Now, get to work making your application useful or something.
